# Simulation-of-Golay-complementary-sequence
In the IEEE 802.11ad standard file, three pairs of gray complementary sequences with lengths of 128, 64 and 32 are defined. Here, I use the 'wlangolaysequence' function in MATLAB to generate a pair of sequences GA and GB with a length of 128 in the standard file, and verify their definitions and characteristics.
