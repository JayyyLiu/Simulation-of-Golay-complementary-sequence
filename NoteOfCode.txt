In this note, details and functions of the code will be introduced:

The whole function of this code is to show main features of Golay complementary sequence.

The Golay 128 sequences are generated as the same of which are defined in file IEEE 802.11.ad-2012, Section 21.11

 The code aims to show that:
1. The sum of autocorrelation of a pair of Golay sequence is an impulse, which means it have one value at center of the output sequence while other elements are all zeros.

2. With certain combination of smaller Golay sequence, the sum of "the sum of autocorrelation of two pairs of Golay sequence" could be zero, which means the two pairs are orthogonal 
that they would not have interference when transforming information by two perpendicular antennas.
